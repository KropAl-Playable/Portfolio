Professional Experience
ChillBase — Senior Playable Ads Developer

Apr 2025 – Present
ChillBase studio focused on playable ad production and creative development.

Responsibilities

Full cycle production of playable ads using Cocos Creator: concept → prototyping → build → delivery.

3D work in Blender: model optimization, UV baking, texture setup, lightmaps and simple animation retargeting.

UI/UX design and iteration for short interactive experiences (rapid prototyping of HUD, onboarding flows, CTA placement).

Asset optimization for web delivery: atlasing, sprite/spritesheet generation, LOD and texture compression strategies.

Localization readiness and dynamic language support for in-game texts and UI.

Preparing and adapting builds for multiple ad networks (size limits, autoplay rules, mute/restore behavior).

Close collaboration with marketing and analytics: tracking KPIs (engagement, session length, CTR proxies), producing actionable hypotheses and test variants.

Selected achievements

Designed and implemented an in-house playable production pipeline (from briefs to build distribution) and associated templates.

Authored multi-page developer and QA guides that standardized builds and reduced rework.

Built a playable-ready asset library assembled from game assets (sprites, rigs, VFX prefabs), enabling faster prototyping.

Delivered 10 high-quality playable creatives (excluding minor A/B/geo variants), improving team throughput and creative consistency.

HotSiberians — Middle → Lead Playable Ads Developer

Apr 2022 – Mar 2025
Worked inside the marketing/creative team to evolve playable production from banners to 3D playables.

Responsibilities

Scriptwriting and concepting: drafting short scenario flows focused on fast comprehension and engagement.

3D creation and adaptation: modelling simple props/characters, texture baking, retopology for web performance.

2D animation and frame-by-frame work for stylized visuals; production of spritesheets and animated elements.

Development of mechanics and interaction code (Cocos Creator / TypeScript prototypes); integration with ad wrappers.

Asset optimization and packaging to meet ad network constraints (size, performance, compatibility).

End-to-end localization and multi-language builds.

Weekly benchmarking and competitor deconstruction: leading calls with marketing to extract technical & narrative learnings and turn them into testable hypotheses.

Mentoring junior developers, coordinating designers and animators, and liaising with product/marketing stakeholders.

Selected achievements

Led the transition of playable development to full 3D, increasing visual fidelity and engagement potential.

Defined and rolled out a structured pipeline and specification template (TЗ) that accelerated handoffs between creatives and devs and reduced clarification cycles.

Introduced lightweight TypeScript usage to the team and advanced internal best practices for Cocos Creator builds.

Established recurring competitive analysis sessions that fed ideation and testing roadmaps.

Writing scenarios and micro-scripts tailored to short ad formats (5–30s flows).

Manual frame-by-frame character animation and spritesheet assembly.

Adapting creatives for different ad networks and placements (responsive banners, fixed sizes, creatives with click-tags).

Basic asset optimization and export tuning to satisfy file size and performance budgets.

Selected achievements

Delivered several interactive banners and playable proofs; consistently met strict size budgets and network requirements.

Built practical competence in hand animation pipelines and small-build optimizations that informed later 3D workflows.
